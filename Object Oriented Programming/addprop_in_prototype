//Change the Prototype to a New Object//
// Up until now you have been adding properties to the prototype individually:

function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name; 
  this.numLegs = numLegs;
}

Dog.prototype = {
  // Add your code below this line
  numLegs: 2,
  eat: function() {console.log("nom nom nom");
  },
  describe: function() {console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
};

// Add the property numLegs and the two methods eat() and describe() to the prototype of Dog by setting the prototype to a new object.
